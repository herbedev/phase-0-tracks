**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is a way to keep track of a users work as a project progresses. Version control is extremly useful because of the ability to have multiple users working on the same document, and have every change documented properly. This helps keep a program organized and makes bugs easier to find.


* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch workspace that allows the user to work without effecting any previous work done, It is also used for organizational purposes . You would use a branch when making any changes to exisiting code or even creating new files.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is when a user decides his work is finished. It records changes to master branch. A good commit message is detailed and describes exactly what was done with the particular commit.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict is when there is a conflict between the current branch you are working on and the branch you want to merge into. Simply the branches do not match up and one has a commit that other does not.
