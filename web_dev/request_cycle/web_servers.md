# 9.1 How the Web Works

### What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
* Give the user complete conrol over the system
* Assumes the user is computer literate from the start
* Allows the user to do EVERYTHING (even if it is unintentionally bad)
* The system assumes you know what you are doing (even if you are not)
* Small is beautiful
* Every program does it's job and only its each job to the best of its abilities
* Use software that has already been created, for example command line commands, which were written a long time ago with a lot more code than we would ever write to do a simple task.
* Portability over effciency


### In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

A vps is a virtual machiene that runs its own individual copy of an operating system. (Linux is free so that is most popular, If you choose to install windows you would have to pay for a copy of windows that runs on every VPS you have). Some advantages of using a VPS include: isolation from anyone else's code or intruders who may or may not accidentally crash the server or casue major issues, complete control over your server, the ability to scale as needed at any times notice, and being able to install any software without having to wait for webhost to support it.
