# jQuery Plan
#### How to stay sane while tackling jQuery.
___
###### I have some VERY LIMITED knowledge of jQuery, most of my experience has come from using plugins that require it.
1. I will scan the docs for some utilities and more of the useful parts of jQuery
2. I will then search online and do some reading about how the development community views and uses jQuery.
3. I plan on picking a sub branch of jQuery like jQuery mobile or jQuery UI and go down that path.
4. Try not to spend too much time on a single part of jQuery, if I get stuck will move on quickly.
5. Use my knowledge of Javascript to help me understand jQuery, it is a Javascript framework after all (right?)
6. As having knowledge of jQuery's existence before taking this course I can fully appreciate you waiting until the last week of phase-0 to introduce it, as it gave me a better understanding of the underlying technology
7. I know I will never get to all of it, not today maybe not ever, because there are always new versions and new components coming out.
8. Keep calm and carry on.
